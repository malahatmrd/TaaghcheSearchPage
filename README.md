**TaaghcheSearchPage** is a practice project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, inspired by the search page of **Taaghche** (an Iranian platform for digital books).  

The project features a searchable list of books, simple category-based filters, a basic shopping cart, and detailed views of individual books.

Initially developed to strengthen HTML and CSS skills, JavaScript was later added to incorporate simple interactivity.
